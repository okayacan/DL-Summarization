# DL_Summarization

# Text Summarization using Python

## Overview
This Python script demonstrates text summarization using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The script takes a piece of text as input and generates a concise summary of the content.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NLTK library

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Install the NLTK library by running: `pip install nltk`

## Usage
1. Run the `summarization.py` script.
2. Provide the path to the text file you want to summarize when prompted.
3. The script will process the text and generate a summary, which will be displayed in the console.

## Example
Suppose you have a text file named `article.txt` containing a lengthy article. To summarize this article, run the script and provide the path to `article.txt` when prompted. The script will then generate a summary of the article, which you can use for quick reference or further analysis.

## Notes
- This script uses NLTK for text processing and summarization.
- The quality of the summary may vary depending on the complexity and length of the input text.
- Feel free to customize the script or integrate it into your projects as needed.
